# Hey 👋 Michael Dlone here.
I do desktop programming, mobile development, web development, server development, and electronic programming with
Arduino. I am fluent in navigating with basic Linux (or *nix) commands, and have some understanding about how computer
system works.

## Programming Languages
My favorites:
- 📚 TypeScript
- 📚 Rust
- 📚 Kotlin (better Java, Kotlin stdlib, functional allowed)

I'm pretty good at:
- 📚 Java
- 📄 JavaScript (not really liking it because no type checking)
- 📄 x86/x86_64 assembly (on NASM, for OS bootloader stuff, CheatEngine)
- 📄 C/C++ (utilizing libstdc++ and smart pointers, but still prefer Rust)
- 📄 Python (was my favourite, was lacking type-checking variables)

Things I'd like to learn:
- 📗 OCaml
- 📘 Zig

I encountered:
- 📄 Go (Hello world program produces big executable, garbage collector)
- 📄 C# (Unity3D game engine script, ASP.NET)
- 📄 Pascal (on TurboPascal)
- 📄 VB/VB .NET/VBScript (on VB6 and Visual Studio)
- 📄 LUA (on Minecraft computer mod stuff)
- 📄 PHP (on Apache)
- 📄 Singkong (built by one of my university lecturer, https://nopri.github.io/)

## Programming Skills
- My preffered programming paradigm: Functional + Object-Oriented Programming (Kotlin, Rust, and TypeScript/JavaScript allows this).
- I do refactoring when necessary and sometimes use design patterns like Builder, Factory, Observer, though I do not overuse them.
- I like the idea of Clean Code, Domain Driven Design, and SOLID principle. But, I usually goes with my own style while
still maintaining the code readability and ease-of-change for others and for my future self (also prefers to avoid overengineering).
- Linux distribution I use: Arch (not Manjaro or any bundled distribution with Desktop Environment out of the box). (Might use NixOS later).

Still learning:
- ⛓️ Peer-to-peer networking
- 🛡️ RSA+ECDH SSH connection concept
- 💻 Tauri desktop application with web browser technology
- ☃️ Creating a Domain Specific Language that uese a new language syntax, like CSS
- ⚒️ Web Service Worker

My Favorites:
- 💥 Solid.js (Similar to react.js)
- ❤️‍🔥 react.js + expressJS/next.js + TypeScript + Sequelize (Full-Stack Webdev)
- ✈️ OpenGL
- 🚅 Regex
- 🎡 Linux cli, env, and build system
- ⚙️ Building Linux packages from source code
- 🛸 TCP/UDP networking, with any programming languages
- 🚁 HTTP/1.1 raw TCP communication
- 🚦 Low-level bit manipulation (and, or, xor, not, roll, shift)

I tried:
- 🌍 Domain Driven Design
- 🚀 SOLID principle
- 🚡 MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
- 🚕 Clean Architecture
- 🍟 Webpack & Vite.js build bundling, for web-based JavaScript bundling
- 🧶 Raw HTTP TCP socket communication with C, Go, Rust, Java, Python
- 🏊 pygame
- ♾️ numpy/matplotlib
- 🎮 Unity3D game making
- 🤖 Tinkering with Arduino
- 💾 MsSQL/MySQL, also to connect from Java and VB.NET to MySQL and MsSQL
- ✨ Creating bootloader trying to create an OS
- 🪅 C# ASP.NET
- 🖼️ Linux From Scratch (LFS) (Only package installing)
- 📱 Android development, with bluetooth for interface with Arduino peripherals
