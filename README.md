# Hey 👋 Michael here.
I do desktop programming, webdev programming, and electronic programming with Arduino. I have basic knowledge of Linux and
how computer system works.

## Stuff I have learned

### Programming Languages
My favorites:
- 📚 TypeScript
- 📚 Rust

I'm pretty good at:
- 📄 JavaScript
- 📚 Java
- 📄 x86/x86_64 assembly (on NASM, for OS bootloader stuff, CheatEngine)

I encountered:
- 📚 Go (Hello world program produces big executable)
- 📚 C/C++/C# (C#, usually on Unity3D game engine script)
- 📄 Kotlin (better version of Java)
- 📄 Python (was my favourite, but lacks type-checking variables)
- 📃 Pascal (on TurboPascal)
- 📃 VB/VB .NET/VBScript (on VB6 and Visual Studio)
- 📃 LUA (on Minecraft computer mod stuff)
- 📃 PHP (on Apache)
- 📃 Singkong (built by one of my lecturer, https://nopri.github.io/)

### Programming Skills
My preffered programming paradigms: Object-Oriented Programming. Refactoring is what I usually do when my code gets too messy. I also like design patterns like Factory, Observer, etc.

Still learning:
- 📃 Domain Driven Design
- 📃 SOLID principle

My Favorites:
- ❤️‍🔥 ReactJS + expressJS/next.js + TypeScript + Sequelize (Full-Stack Webdev)
- ✈️ OpenGL
- 🚅 Regex
- 🎡 Linux cli, env, and build system (I use arch btw)

I'm pretty good at:
- 🚡 MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
- 🚕 Clean Architecture

I tried:
- 🧶 Raw HTTP TCP socket communication with C, Go, Rust, Java.
- 🏊 pygame
- ♾️ numpy/matplotlib
- 🎮 Unity3D game making
- 🤖 Tinkering with Arduino
- 💾 MsSQL/MySQL, also to connect from Java and VB.NET to MySQL and MsSQL
- ✨ Creating bootloader trying to create an OS.
